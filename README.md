=========

Using existing XML parser and transform the content of an XML document into an HTML page

This work is an HTML/JavaScript program, which takes the URL of an XML document containing plant catalog information, parses the
XML file, and extracts the list of plants, displaying them in a table. 

The JavaScript program will be embedded in an HTML file so that it can be executed within a browser.

Note

Main: index.html

All xml files contain plants information that could be use as test cases.

All jpg files are picture of plants
